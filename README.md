# Tree Hut Social Media Trends Analysis


This project analyzes ~18,000 comments from Tree Hut (March 2025) to identify customer sentiment, trending flavours, and themes of discussion.  
The goal is to provide social media managers and product managers with actionable insights into what customers are saying, and how these trends shift over time.

## ðŸš€ Setup & Requirements

1. **Clone repo / unzip project**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <your-repo>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Key packages used:
   - `pandas`, `numpy` â€” data processing
   - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud` â€” visualization
   - `nltk`, `scikit-learn` â€” text preprocessing & clustering
   - `vaderSentiment` â€” sentiment analysis
   - `spacy` â€” NER (for country detection)
   - `ollama` â€” LLM-assisted sentiment, flavours and theme extraction

3. **Download NLTK stopwords**
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download("stopwords")
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed emojis, hashtags, mentions, URLs, promo codes, and extra punctuation.
   - Normalized casing and stripped whitespace.

2. **Feature Engineering and Useful Segments**
   - Extracted `day`, `month`, `quarter`, and `season` from `timestamp`.
   - Built `clean_comment` text field.
   - Classified `sentiment` (Positive / Negative / Neutral).
   - Extracted `flavours` (LLM-based + keyword fallback).
   - Assigned `themes` across 10 categories (Fragrance, Availability, Packaging, etc.).

3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Sentiment distribution overall and by flavour.
   - Top flavours by mentions & positivity %.
   - Trend analysis across **day / month / season**.
     
4. **Insights Extraction**
   - LLM-assisted top-3 insights per theme.

- **Slides (`Report_Presentation.pptx` / `.pdf`)**: Executive-ready summary of findings with visuals.
- **README.md**: Setup + documentation.
- **Requirements.txt**: Requirements File to Install and Run the Notebook.

## ðŸ”® Extension Proposal

If extended to a full project:
1. **Scale the Analysis** â€” expand from this sample to the full dataset with automated pipelines across months and years to capture **seasonal and yearly trends**.  
2. **LLM + Clustering Hybrid** â€” combine unsupervised clustering with LLM-based labeling to detect **emerging themes** without manual rule-based bottlenecks.  
3. **Granular Segmentation** â€” enrich insights by **region, retailer (Walmart, Ulta, Target), product line**, and even **customer age groups** for localized strategies.  
4. **Automation & Monitoring** â€” productionize workflows with **Airflow/Prefect**, create dashboards in **Looker/Tableau**, and set up ongoing monitoring pipelines.  
5. **Early Warning System** â€” implement real-time detection of **negative sentiment spikes** (e.g., drain issues, discontinued scent demand) to proactively address complaints.  
6. **Product Roadmap Integration** â€” feed insights into **flavour revival**, **packaging redesign**, and **pricing strategy** discussions with product managers.  
7. **Influencer & UGC Opportunity** â€” identify comments requesting **collabs, contests, or influencer tie-ins** to strengthen community engagement.
